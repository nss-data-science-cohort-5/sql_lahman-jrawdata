6) Which managers have won the TSN Manager of the Year award in both the National League (NL) and the American League (AL)? Give their full name and the teams that they were managing when they won the award.

7) Which pitcher was the least efficient in 2016 in terms of salary / strikeouts? Only consider pitchers who started at least 10 games (across all teams). Note that pitchers often play for more than one team in a season, so be sure that you are counting all stats for each player.

8) Find all players who have had at least 3000 career hits. Report those players' names, total number of hits, and the year they were inducted into the hall of fame (If they were not inducted into the hall of fame, put a null in that column.) Note that a player being inducted into the hall of fame is indicated by a 'Y' in the inducted column of the halloffame table.

9) Find all players who had at least 1,000 hits for two different teams. Report those players' full names.

10) Find all players who hit their career highest number of home runs in 2016. Consider only players who have played in the league for at least 10 years, and who hit at least one home run in 2016. Report the players' first and last names and the number of home runs they hit in 2016.

After finishing the above questions, here are some open-ended questions to consider.

Open-ended questions

Is there any correlation between number of wins and team salary? Use data from 2000 and later to answer this question. As you do this analysis, keep in mind that salaries across the whole league tend to increase together, so you may want to look on a year-by-year basis.

In this question, you will explore the connection between number of wins and attendance.

a. Does there appear to be any correlation between attendance at home games and number of wins?
b. Do teams that win the world series see a boost in attendance the following year? What about teams that made the playoffs? Making the playoffs means either being a division winner or a wild card winner.

It is thought that since left-handed pitchers are more rare, causing batters to face them less often, that they are more effective. Investigate this claim and present evidence to either support or dispute this claim. First, determine just how rare left-handed pitchers are compared with right-handed pitchers. Are left-handed pitchers more likely to win the Cy Young Award? Are they more likely to make it into the hall of fame?
